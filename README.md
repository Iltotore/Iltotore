### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is RaphaÃ«l Fromentin, I'm 16 years old and I study at LycÃ©e Fragonard in France.
I love programming and mainly use Scala and Java.

I'm currently working around/on [Dotty](https://github.com/lampepfl/Dotty)'s typing system ([ScalaLint](https://github.com/Iltotore/ScalaLint), [exclusion types](https://github.com/Iltotore/dotty/tree/exclusion-type) ([related issue](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-feature-requests/issues/177)) etc...)
