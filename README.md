Student at CY Tech in France and Scala enthusiast.

I enjoy making libraries and productivity-based tools.

Currently working on:
- [Iron](https://github.com/Iltotore/Iron)
- [CYLang](https://github.com/Iltotore/cylang)


TODO in 2023:
- [x] [Iron](https://github.com/Iltotore/iron) v2.0.0
- [x] Finish an article about the benefits of Scala as the first programming language to teach
- [x] [Iron](https://github.com/Iltotore/iron) v2.1.0
- [ ] Other side projects
- [ ] Maybe a SIP for [multi-level enums](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/proposal-for-multi-level-enums/3344/1)
- [ ] A Mill PoC in Scala 3 (waiting for some Dotty issues to be solved)
