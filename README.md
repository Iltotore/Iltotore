### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is RaphaÃ«l Fromentin, I'm 17 years old and I study at LycÃ©e Fragonard in France.
I love programming and mainly use Scala and Java.

I'm currently working around/on [Dotty](https://github.com/lampepfl/Dotty)'s typing system:
- [ScalaLint](https://github.com/Iltotore/ScalaLint)
- [Exclusion Types](https://github.com/Iltotore/dotty/tree/exclusion-type) ([related issue](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-feature-requests/issues/177))
- [Opaque Type Constraints](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/inline-methods-and-opaque-types/5051)
