Student at CY Tech in France and Scala enthusiast.

I enjoy making libraries and productivity-based tools.

Currently working on:
- [Iron](https://github.com/Iltotore/Iron)
- [A Scala API for Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/pidove-project/scala-showdown-api)

My articles:
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Learn Scala 3 series ([first chapter](https://hub.notaname.fr/langages/scala/programmer-en-scala-3-prerequis.html))
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· [The benefits of Scala as the first programming language to teach](https://hub.notaname.fr/langages/scala/scala-comme-premier-langage.html)

TODO in 2023:
- [x] [Iron](https://github.com/Iltotore/iron) v2.0.0
- [x] An article about [the benefits of Scala as the first programming language to teach](https://hub.notaname.fr/langages/scala/scala-comme-premier-langage.html)
